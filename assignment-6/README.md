## Assignment 6

###Train

Implement TwoLayerNet class.
Train your network with MNIST training dataset.
Save the network as a pickle file (your_last_name_mnist_nn_model.pkl)

###Test
Use your own trained network to test your handwritten digit. 
Five images per class (you have done this in Assignment 5)

###Deliverables
A new common.py must have following functions.
sigmoid(a) and softmax(a)
numerical_gradient(f, x)
loss() functions.
two_layer_net.py for TwoLayerNet class
train.py for training your neural network.

your_first_name_mnist_nn_model.pkl for your neural network model

test.py for testing your neural network.
module6.ipynb to show your train.py and test.py are working properly.
